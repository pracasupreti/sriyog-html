                                        foreign exchange providers like High St banks.
                                        <p>The process is simple; most service providers make money on foreign exchange by adding a margin &#x2013; known as a &#x2018;spread&#x2019; &#x2013; to the rate they buy the currency at before selling it you. At
                                            WorldFirst we simply take a smaller spread than most banks.</p>
                                        <p>WorldFirst is one of the UK&apos;s leading currency brokers, having already helped move more than &#xA3;60bn around the world for nearly 100,000 clients since 2004.</p>

                                            Swedish kroner, it will be 1 day; for East Caribbean Dollars it could be 4 days. Transfers to Australia and New Zealand will usually clear within 24 hours.</p>

                                            <p>You can send your money to us by either of these 5 methods:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Debit Card: If you&apos;re a private client you can use your debit card to send us your money. This is one of the fastest ways you can pay.</li>
                                                <li>Online/Telephone Banking (Faster Payment): This usually arrives with us the same day or the following morning.</li>
                                                <li>BACS: A BACS payment takes two working days for funds to arrive. They will be cleared funds on the third day, which is when your payment will be able to leave WorldFirst.</li>
                                                <li>Direct Debit: If you&apos;re sending us GBP funds, we can collect them by Direct Debit. Talk to us if you&apos;d like to set one up. Once this is done, we arrange collection of the funds and it is similar
                                                    to a BACS payment in terms of clearing times.</li>
                                                <li>CHAPS: A CHAPS payment is a same-day payment and will arrive with us on the day you send it.</li>

                                                to liaise with our bank until the issue has been resolved and the beneficiary has received the funds, and we promise to keep you informed every step of the way.</p>
                                            <p>WorldFirst can initiate a non-receipt investigation (trace) if funds have not reached the beneficiary in an appropriate amount of time. The most common reason for delays are below:</p>
                                            <ol type="i">
                                                <li><strong>Further Information Request:</strong> Our correspondent banks and/or their banking partners may request further information on a payment. It will be released when a satisfactory response has been
                                                    supplied.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>Incorrect Details:</strong> Before launching a trace on your payment, it is a good idea to check the payment details with your beneficiary. If the details are indeed incorrect, an amendment would
                                                    be more appropriate in most cases.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Value Date:</strong> Select currencies cannot credit the beneficiary on the same day as we make the payment - your account manager will be able to confirm this detail for you.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>For most of our payments, you may request a copy of the outbound payment message sent to your beneficiary&#x2019;s bank. This will contain all the beneficiary details that you confirmed for the payment.</p>
                                            <p>All of these details will provide the beneficiary bank an opportunity to verify the payment against their own records.</p>
